# HackCU---007
Hack that will be submitted to the HackCU - 007 (2021) hackathon for the beginner track. I will be working on my own to create the hack.

The hack was decided to be a slot machine that the user was able to play and test their luck! Inspiration came from my favorite 007 movie - Casino Royale.
I implemented the hack in VS Code using C++. I was hoping to learn how to create a GUI to make the hack more appealing to the user, however I was unable to find
sufficient resources to implement this.
